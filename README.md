# About 
 I am a passionate and driven junior data analyst, eager to apply my analytical skills and knowledge in real-world projects. With a strong foundation in data analysis, I am proficient in tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI, which I use to gather, clean, visualize, and interpret data. My goal is to translate complex data sets into actionable insights that can drive strategic decision-making.

 Here is a collection of my data analysis project. I have done for internships and self_learning
